353,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,(4) Ensure no alterations or deformations of the airframe surface have been made that would affect the relationship between air pressure in the static pressure system and true ambient static air pressure for any flight condition.
354,43,Appendix D,-,B,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,(b) Altimeter:
355,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(1) Test by an appropriately rated repair facility in accordance with the following
subparagraphs. Unless otherwise specified, each test for performance may be conducted with the instrument subjected to vibration. When tests are conducted with the temperature substantially different from ambient temperature of approximately 25 °C, allowance must be made for the variation from the specified condition."
356,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(i) Scale error. With the barometric pressure scale at 10 132.1 hPa, the altimeter must be
subjected successively to pressures corresponding to the altitude specified in Table D–1
up to the maximum normally expected operating altitude of the aircraft in which the altimeter is to be installed. The reduction in pressure must be made at a rate not in excess of 20 000 ft (6 096 m) per minute to within approximately 2 000 ft (609.6 m) of the test point. The test point must be approached at a rate compatible with the test equipment. The altimeter must be kept at the pressure corresponding to each test point for at least 1 minute, but not more than 10 minutes, before a reading is taken. The error at all test points must not exceed the Jtolerances specified in Table D–1."
357,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(ii) Hysteresis. The hysteresis test must begin not more than 15 minutes after the altimeter’s initial exposure to the pressure corresponding to the upper limit of the scale error test prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this appendix; and while the altimeter is at this pressure, the hysteresis test must commence. Pressure must be increased at a rate simulating a descent in altitude at the rate of 5 000 to 20 000 ft (1 524 to 6 096 m) per minute until within 3 000 ft (914.4 m) of the first test point (50 percent of maximum altitude). The test point must then be approached at a rate of approximately 3 000 ft (914.4 m) per minute. The altimeter must be kept at this pressure for at least 5 minutes, but not more than 15 minutes, before the test reading is taken. After the reading has been taken, the pressure must be increased further, in the same manner as before, until the pressure corresponding to the second test point (40 percent of maximum altitude) is reached. The altimeter must be kept at this pressure for at least 1 minute, but not more than 10 minutes, before the test reading is taken. After the reading has been taken, the pressure must be increased further, in the same manner as before, until atmospheric pressure is reached. The reading of the altimeter at either of the two test points must not differ by more than the tolerance specified in Table D–2 from the reading of the altimeter for the corresponding altitude recorded during the scale error test prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this appendix."
358,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(iii) After effect. Not more than 5 minutes after the completion of the hysteresis test
prescribed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this appendix, the reading of the altimeter (corrected for any change in atmospheric pressure) must not differ from the original atmospheric pressure reading by more than the tolerance specified in Table D–2."
359,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(iv) Friction. The altimeter must be subjected to a steady rate of decrease of pressure
approximating 750 ft (226 m) per minute. At each altitude listed in Table D–3, the change in reading of the pointers after vibration must not exceed the corresponding tolerance listed in Table D–3."
360,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(v) Case leak. The leakage of the altimeter case, when the pressure within it corresponds to an altitude of 18 000 ft (5 486 m), must not change the altimeter reading by more than the tolerance shown in Table D–2 during an interval of 1 minute."
361,43,Appendix D,-,-,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(vi) Barometric scale error. At constant atmospheric pressure, the barometric pressure
scale must be set at each of the pressures (falling within its range of adjustment) listed in
Table D–4, and must cause the pointer to indicate the equivalent altitude difference shown in Table D–4 with a tolerance of 25 ft (7.6 m)."
362,43,Appendix D,-,C,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(c) Automatic pressure altitude reporting equipment and ATC transponder system integration test. The test must be conducted by an appropriately rated person under the conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this appendix. Measure the automatic pressure altitude at the output of the installed ATC transponder when interrogated on Mode C at a sufficient number of test points to ensure the altitude reporting equipment, altimeters, and ATC transponders perform their intended functions as installed in the aircraft. The difference between the automatic reporting output and the altitude displayed at the altimeter must not exceed 125 ft (38.1 m)."
363,43,Appendix D,-,,Appendix D to GACAR Part 43 - Altimeter System Test and Inspection,-,"(d) Records. Comply with the provisions of GACAR § 43.11 as to content, form, and disposition of the records.
