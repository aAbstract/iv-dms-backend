If, in the meantime, such aircraft is unable to establish communication with the RCC or ATSU, it must, by mutual agreement, hand over to an aircraft capable of establishing and maintaining such communications until the arrival of the first search and rescue aircraft.;\n  - (c) When it is necessary for an aircraft to convey information to survivors or surface rescue units, and two-way communication is not available, it must, if practicable, drop communication equipment that would enable direct contact to be established, or convey the information by dropping a hard copy message.;\n  - (d) When a ground signal has been displayed, the aircraft must indicate whether the signal has been understood or not by the means described in Appendix I to this part, or, if this is not practicable, by making the appropriate visual signal.;\n  - (e) When it is necessary for an aircraft to direct a surface craft to the place where an aircraft or surface craft is in distress, the aircraft must do so by transmitting precise instructions by any means at its disposal. If no radio communication can be established, the aircraft must make the appropriate visual signal.;\n",
