Unless otherwise prescribed in GACAR \u00a7 91.95, each PIC who\r\noperates an aircraft in a Class D airspace area must maintain two way radio communications with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over that area.\r(1) If the aircraft radio fails in flight under IFR, the pilot must comply with GACAR \u00a7 91.207.;(2) If the aircraft radio fails in flight under VFR, the PIC may operate the aircraft and land if\u2013\u2013\r\n- (i) Weather conditions are at or above basic VFR weather minimums,\r\n- (ii) Visual contact with the tower is maintained, and\r\n- (iii) A clearance to land is received.;\n  - (e) Minimum altitudes when operating to an aerodrome in Class D airspace.\r(1) Unless required by the applicable distance\u2013from\u2013cloud criteria, each PIC operating a large or turbine powered airplane must enter the traffic pattern at an altitude of at least 1 500 ft (450 m) above the elevation of the aerodrome and maintain at least 1 500 ft (450 m) until further descent is required for a safe landing.;(2) Each PIC operating a large or turbine\u2013powered airplane approaching to land on a runway served by an instrument approach procedure with vertical guidance (APV), if the airplane is so equipped, must\u2014\r\n- (i) Operate the airplane at an altitude at or above the glide path between the published final approach fix and the DA or DH, as applicable or\r\n- (ii) If compliance with the applicable distance\u2013from\u2013cloud criteria requires glide path\r\ninterception closer in, operate the airplane at or above the glide path, between the point of interception of glide path and the DA or the DH.;(3) Each PIC operating an airplane approaching to land on a runway served by a visual\r\napproach slope indicator must maintain an altitude at or above the glide path until a lower altitude is necessary for a safe landing.;(4) Paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section do not prohibit normal bracketing maneuvers above or below the glide path that are conducted for the purpose of remaining on the glide path.;\n  - (f) Approaches. Except when conducting a circling approach or unless otherwise required by ATC, each PIC must\u2013\u2013\r(1) Circle the aerodrome to the left, if operating an airplane or;(2) Avoid the flow of fixed\u2013wing aircraft, if operating a rotorcraft.;\n  - (g) Departures. No PIC may operate an aircraft departing from an aerodrome except in compliance with the following:\r(1) Each PIC must comply with any departure procedures established for the aerodrome by the GACA.;(2) Unless otherwise required by the prescribed departure procedure for the aerodrome or the applicable distance\u2013from\u2013clouds criteria, each PIC of a large or turbine\u2013powered airplane must climb to an altitude of 1 500 ft (450 m) above the surface as rapidly as practicable.;\n  - (h) Noise abatement. Where a formal runway use program has been established by the GACA, each PIC of a large or turbine\u2013powered airplane assigned a noise abatement runway by ATC must use that runway. However, consistent with the final authority of the PIC concerning the safe operation of the aircraft as prescribed in GACAR \u00a7 91.3(a), ATC may assign a different runway if requested by the PIC or his designee in the interest of safety.;\n- (i) Takeoff, landing, taxi clearance. No person may, at any aerodrome with an operating control tower, operate an aircraft on a runway or taxiway, or take off or land an aircraft, unless an appropriate clearance is received from ATC. A clearance to taxi to the takeoff runway assigned to the aircraft is not a clearance to cross that assigned takeoff runway, or to taxi on that runway at any point, or to cross other runways that intersect the taxi route to that assigned takeoff runway. A clearance to taxi to any point other than an assigned takeoff runway is not a clearance to cross any runways that intersect the taxi route to that point.;\n",

For aircraft using VOR for navigation, this applies only when the aircraft is within 22 NM of that VOR (based on the reasonable estimate by the PIC operating the aircraft of that distance); or;(2) If no applicable minimum altitude is prescribed in GACAR Parts 71 and 97, then\u2013\u2013\r\n- (i) In the case of operations over an area designated under GACAR Part 71 as a\r\nmountainous zone, an altitude of 2 000 ft (600 m) above the highest obstacle within a\r\nhorizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown; or \r\n- (ii) In any other case, an altitude of 1 000 ft (300 m) above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of 4 NM from the course to be flown.;\n  - (b) Climb. Climb to a higher minimum IFR altitude must begin immediately after passing the point beyond which that minimum altitude applies, except that when ground obstructions intervene, the point beyond which that higher minimum altitude applies must be crossed at or above the applicable minimum crossing altitude.;\n",
