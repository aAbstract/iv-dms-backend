The reactive process must identify the contribution of fatigue hazards to reports and events associated with potential negative safety consequences in order to determine how the impact of fatigue could have been minimized. At a minimum, the process may be triggered by any of the following:
(i) Fatigue reports;"
1,5,-,APPENDIX G,-,II,a3 (ii),-,,FATIGUE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FRMS),FATIGUE RISK MANAGEMENT Processes,(ii) Confidential reports;
1,5,-,APPENDIX G,-,II,a3 (iii),-,,FATIGUE RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (FRMS),FATIGUE RISK MANAGEMENT Processes,(iii) Audit reports;
