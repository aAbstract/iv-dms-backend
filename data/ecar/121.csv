provided in two volumes. One volume presents “in-flight” data, i.e. limitations, normal and
emergency checklists, normal and emergency procedures and amplification of these
procedures, and in-flight performance data. The operator should issue operating instructions
and provide information on aeroplane climb performance with all engines operating to enable
the pilot-in-command to determine the climb gradient that can be achieved during the departure
phase for the existing take-off conditions and intended take-off technique. This information
should be included in the operations manual.. The second volume presents aircraft system
descriptions and flight performance data for use in flight planning. All data and information in
this manual must comply with the flight manual, where applicable. In general, the
responsibility for developing and issuing amendments and revisions to these manuals rests with
the aircraft manufacturer. Operators may develop additional instructions, procedures or
guidance to be inserted in this manual. Such operator-developed additions should only be for
clarification or expansion of the manufacturer's material, where necessary. The design of the
manual shall observe Human Factors principles"

of the lists."

this is published in the aircraft operating manual. Based on this data, operators often produce
their own performance manual which presents performance information for the operator's own
route network. This manual typically contains take-off and landing data for each usable
runway at each destination and alternate airport. Where an operator has a very extensive route
network, the information could be presented in separate volumes for different geographical
areas. Cruise control information is often included in the performance manual. The manual
must contain information on the method of derivation of the data presented, which must be in
agreement with the data presented in the aircraft flight manual. The manual must also include

(c) The executive responsible for the manual must approve amendments, revisions and
additions to the operations manual. In some cases this will consist of ensuring that such
changes issued by the originator of a particular volume are correct and appropriate to the
operations manual. This would be the case with amendments issued by the aircraft
manufacturer for the operating manuals, or with amendments issued for the route guide,
when the route guide is purchased from a commercial agency. However, in the case of
amendments or additions, which originate within the organization, the executive
responsible must ascertain that the proposed change is necessary and determine how it is to
be promulgated. In most cases the amendment will be issued through normal channels to
all holders of the operations manual. In other cases, because of the urgency of the
information contained in the amendment it will be necessary to issue a notice to the
cockpit crew and to other concerned operational personnel. This notice shall be replaced
by an amendment to the manual as soon as possible. In revising or altering the contents of
the operations manual, operators must bear in mind that the ECAA is required to approve
the contents of the operations manual and that certain parts of the manual include material,
which is considered mandatory. It is therefore necessary that the amendments be approved
by the ECAA. In practice, since much of the material in an operations manual only
requires the general approval of the ECAA, it is often appropriate to agree with the
authority which parts of the operations manual need the specific approval of that authority
before they are amended and which parts only require notification of changes made."

Handwritten amendments to an operations manual are generally not acceptable. The new

letter or covering sheet must identify the reason for the amendment and provide a checklist
of the amendment to be made. This is particularly important when an amendment is made
to any safety-related information. Instructions shall be included for inserting the
amendment in the appropriate volume and for recording insertion of the amendment. The
signature of the executive approving the amendment must also appear. A revision to the
