(i) New aircraft are normally weighed at the factory and are eligible to be placed into operation without reweighing if the mass and balance records have been adjusted for alterations or modifications to the aircraft. Aircraft transferred from one operator with an approved mass control programme to another operator with an approved programme need not be weighed prior to use by the receiving operator until 4 years have elapsed since the last weighing ; and
(ii) The individual mass and Centre of Gravity (CG) position of each aircraft shall be re-established periodically. The maximum interval between two weightings must be defined by the operator and must meet this section requirements. In addition, the mass and the CG of each aircraft shall be re-established, whenever the cumulative changes to the dry operating mass exceed ± 0.5% of the maximum landing mass or the cumulative change in CG position exceeds 0.5% of the mean aerodynamic chord, either by:
(A) Weighing; or

(i) For a fleet or group of aircraft of the same model and configuration, an average dry operating mass and CG position may be used as the fleet mass and CG position, provided that the dry operating masses and CG positions of the individual aircraft meet the tolerances specified in sub-paragraph (ii) below. Furthermore, the criteria specified in sub-paragraphs (iii), (iv) and (a)(3) below are applicable;
(ii) Tolerances:
(A) If the dry operating mass of any aircraft weighed, or the calculated dry operating mass of any aircraft of a fleet, varies by more than ±0.5% of the maximum structural landing mass from the established dry operating fleet mass or the CG position varies by more than ±0.5 % of the mean aero-dynamic chord from the fleet CG, that aircraft shall be omitted from that fleet. Separate fleets may be established, each with differing fleet mean masses;
(B) In cases where the aircraft mass is within the dry operating fleet mass tolerance but its CG position falls outside the permitted fleet tolerance, the aircraft may still be operated under the applicable dry operating fleet mass but with an individual CG position;
(C) If an individual aircraft has, when compared with other aircraft of the fleet, a physical, accurately accountable difference (e.g. galley or seat configuration), that causes exceedance of the fleet tolerances, this aircraft may be maintained in the fleet provided that appropriate corrections are applied to the mass and/or CG position for that aircraft; and
(D) Aircraft for which no mean aerodynamic chord has been published must be operated with their individual mass and CG position values or must be subjected to a special study and approval.
(iii) Use of fleet values:
(A) After the weighing of an aircraft, or if any change occurs in the aircraft equipment or configuration, the operator must verify that this aircraft falls within the tolerances specified in sub-paragraph (2)(ii) above;
(B) Aircraft which have not been weighed since the last fleet mass evaluation can still be kept in a fleet operated with fleet values, provided that the individual values are revised by computation and stay within the tolerances defined in sub-paragraph (2)(ii) above. If these individual values no longer fall within the permitted tolerances, the operator must either determine new fleet values fulfilling the conditions of sub-paragraphs (2)(i) and (2)(ii) above, or operate the aircraft not falling within the limits with their individual values ; and
(C) To add an aircraft to a fleet operated with fleet values, the operator must verify by weighing or computation that its actual values fall within the tolerances specified in sub-paragraph (2)(ii) above.

This improved situational awareness can also reduce errors in flight operations and improve the pilot‘s ability to transition between instrument and visual references as meteorological conditions change. Flight operations applications may include the following: (a) Enhanced situational awareness during all flight operations, but especially during taxi, take-off, approach and landing;
(b) Reduced flight technical error during take-off, approach and landing; and
(c) Improvements in performance due to precise prediction of touchdown area, tail strike awareness/warning and rapid recognition of and recovery from unusual attitudes."

a) To supplement conventional flight deck instrumentation in the performance of a particular task or operation. The primary cockpit instruments remain the primary means for manually controlling or manoeuvring the aircraft; and
b) As a primary flight display:
(1) Information presented by the HUD may be used by the pilot in lieu of scanning head-down displays. Operational approval of a HUD for such use allows the pilot to control the aircraft by reference to the HUD for approved ground or flight operations; and
2) Information presented by the HUD may be used as a means to achieve additional navigation or control performance. The required information is displayed on the HUD. Operational credit, in the form of lower minima, for a HUD used for this purpose may be approved for a particular aircraft or automatic flight control system.

1860,91,Appendix K,4,4.1,"HEAD-UP DISPLAY (HUD), EQUIVALENT DISPLAYS AND VISION SYSTEMS",Operational Credits,"4.1 Aerodrome operating minima are expressed in terms of minimum visibility/RVR and MDA/H or DA/H. With respect to operational credit this means that the visibility/RVR requirements, established in the instrument approach procedure, may be reduced or satisfied for aircraft equipped with appropriately approved vision systems such as EVS. Reasons for granting operational credit may be when aircraft are better equipped than what was originally considered when designing the instrument approach procedure or when runway visual aids considered in the design of the procedure are not available but can be compensated for by on-board equipment."
1861,91,Appendix K,4,4.2,"HEAD-UP DISPLAY (HUD), EQUIVALENT DISPLAYS AND VISION SYSTEMS",Operational Credits,"4.2 Credits related to visibility/RVR can be given using at least three concepts. The first concept is to reduce the required RVR which will allow the aircraft to continue the approach beyond the approach ban point with a reported RVR lower than what was established for the approach procedure. Where a minimum visibility is prescribed, a second concept to grant operational credit may be used. In this case, the required minimum visibility is kept unchanged, but it is satisfied by means of the on-board equipment, typically an EVS. The result of both these concepts is that operations are allowed in meteorological conditions where otherwise they would not be possible. A third concept is to give operational credit by allowing operations in visibility/RVR which are not lower than those established for the approach procedure, but the approach operation is conducted with less facilities on the ground. One example of the latter is to allow Category II operations without touchdown and/or centre line lights, compensated for by additional on-board equipment, e.g. a HUD."

However, the standard operating procedures for these types of operations need to be specified in the operations manual. An example of this type of operation may include an EVS or an SVS on a head-down display that is used only for situational awareness of the surrounding area of the aircraft during ground operations where the display is not in the pilot‘s primary field of view. For enhanced situational awareness, the installation and operational procedures need to ensure that the operation of the vision system does not interfere with normal procedures or the operation or use of other aircraft systems. In some cases, modifications to these normal procedures for other aircraft systems or equipment may be necessary to ensure compatibility."

Research conducted in altitude chambers or by exposure to mountain elevations indicates that human tolerance could be related to the altitude concerned and the exposure time. The subject is dealt with in detail in the Manual of Civil Aviation Medicine (Doc 8984). In light of the above and to further assist the pilot-in-command in providing the oxygen supply intended by 2.2.3.8 of this Annex, the following guidelines, which take into account the requirements already established in Annex 6, Part I, are considered relevant"

Vision systems can also consist of a combination of these two systems called combined vision systems (CVS). Such a system may display electronic real-time images of the external scene using the EVS component of the system. The information from vision systems may be displayed head-up and/or head-down. Operational credit may be granted to vision systems which are appropriately qualified."
1918,91,Attachement 2,iii,2.1,Vision System,General,2.1.2 Light emitting diode (LED) lights may not be visible to infrared-based vision systems. Operators of such vision systems will need to acquire information about the LED implementation programmes at aerodromes where they intend to operate. More details about the consequences of LED lights are contained in the Manual of All-Weather Operations (Doc 9365).
1919,91,Attachement 2,iii,2.2,Vision System,Operational applications,"2.2.1 Flight operations with EVS allow the pilot to view an image of the external scene obscured by darkness or other visibility restrictions. The use of EVS will also allow acquisition of an image of the external scene earlier than with natural, unaided vision, hence providing for a smoother transition to references by natural vision. The improved acquisition of an image of the external scene may improve situational awareness. It may also qualify for operational credit if the information from the vision system is presented to the pilots in a suitable way and the necessary airworthiness approval and specific approval by the State of Registry have been obtained for the combined system"

1921,91,Attachement 2,iii,2.3,Vision System,Operational Concept,"2.3.1 Instrument approach operations include an instrument phase and a visual phase. The instrument phase ends at the published MDA/H or DA/H unless a missed approach is initiated. Using the EVS or CVS does not change the applicable MDA/H or DA/H. The continued approach to landing from MDA/H or DA/H will be conducted using visual references. This also applies to operations with vision systems. The difference is that the visual references will be acquired by use of an EVS or CVS, natural vision or the vision system in combination with natural vision."
1922,91,Attachement 2,iii,2.3,Vision System,Operational Concept,"2.3.2 Down to a defined height in the visual segment, typically at or above 30 m (100 ft), the visual references may be acquired solely by means of the vision system. The defined height depends on the airworthiness approval and the specific approval by the State of Registry. Below this height the visual references should be solely based on natural vision. In the most advanced applications, the vision system may be used down to touchdown without the requirement for natural vision acquisition of visual references. This means that such a vision system may be the sole means of acquiring visual references and can be used without natural vision                                             Figure 1.1.
