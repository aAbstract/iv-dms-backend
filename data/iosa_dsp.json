    "applicability": "Applicability\nSection 3 addresses the requirements for operational control of flights conducted by multi-engine aircraft\nand is applicable to an operator that conducts such flights, whether operational control functions are\nconducted by the operator or conducted for the operator by an external organization (outsourced). Specific\nprovisions of this section are applicable to an operator based on the operational system in use, the manner\nin which authority is delegated by the operator, and the responsibilities, functions, duties or tasks assigned\nto the personnel involved.\nThe IOSA standards and recommended practices (ISARPs) in Section 3 are applicable only to those\naircraft that are of the type authorized in the Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and used in commercial\npassenger and/or cargo operations, unless applicability is extended to encompass non-commercial\noperations as stated in a note immediately under the body of the provision.\nSubsections 3.5,4.1,4.3, and 4.6 contain provisions that allow for the use of variations, including\nOperational Variations approved by the Authority, to achieve conformity with eligible aircraft tracking,\nalternate airport, fuel planning and EDTO specifications. General guidance related to the safety risk\nmanagement (SRM) processes necessary to develop and use all such variations prefaces subsection 4.\nTable 3.1 categorizes the personnel that are delegated the authority to exercise operational control,\nassigned the overall responsibility for the overall operational control of a flight, assigned the individual\nresponsibility to carry out one or more functions, duties or tasks related to the operational control of a flight,\nor assigned the duty to provide administrative support to others with responsibilities related to operational\ncontrol.\nTable 3.5 defines the competencies of operational control personnel appropriate to the assignment of\noverall responsibility for operational control and/or to carry out one or more operational control functions,\nduties or tasks according to their specific competencies.\nAll personnel used to perform operational control functions as defined in Table 3.1 ,or that act in a manner\nconsistent with the functional categories specified in Table 3.1 and the competencies specified in Table\n3.5, irrespective of management or post holder title, are subject to specified training and qualification\nprovisions in this section relevant to the operational control function performed.\nIndividual DSP provisions, and/or individual sub-specifications within a DSP provision, that:\n Do not begin with a conditional phrase are applicable to all operators unless determined otherwise\nby the Auditor.\n Begin with a conditional phrase ( If the Operator... ) are applicable if the operator meets the\ncondition(s) stated in the phrase. The conditional phrase serves to define or limit the applicability\nof the provision (e.g.  If the operator uses   or  If an FOO or FOA is used  ).\n Begin with a conditional phrase that specifies the use of a Flight Operations Officer (FOO) by an\noperator are applicable when the operator assigns the FOO, as defined in the IRM and delegated\nauthority in accordance with Table 3.1 , responsibility to carry out operational control functions,\nduties or tasks related to allof the competencies of operational control as specified in Table 3.5 .\n Begin with a conditional phrase that specifies the use of a Flight Operations Assistant (FOA) by an\noperator are applicable when the operator assigns the FOA, as defined in the IRM, responsibility\nto carry out operational control functions, duties or tasks related to one or more, but not all,\ncompetencies of operational control as specified in Table 3.5 .\n Are applicable to all systems of operational control, but with differences in application to each\nsystem, will have those differences explained in the associated Guidance Material (GM).\n Contain the phrase  personnel responsible for operational control  or  personnel with responsibility\nfor operational control  refer to any suitably qualified personnel with responsibility for operational\ncontrol as designated by the operator, to include the pilot-in-command (PIC) unless otherwise\nannotated. \n Contain training and qualification requirements are applicable to personnel, other than the PIC,\nthat are assigned responsibilities related to the operational control of flights. PIC training and\nqualification requirements for all systems of operational control are specified in ISM Section 2\n(FLT).\n Are eligible for conformance using variations, including Operational Variations approved by the\nAuthority, that contain a note referring to the additional SRM and safety monitoring requirements\nnecessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety is maintained.\nWhere operational functions, duties or tasks associated with operational control are outsourced to external\nservice providers, an operator retains overall responsibility for ensuring the management of safety in the\noperational control of flights and must demonstrate processes for monitoring applicable external service\nproviders in accordance with DSP 1.11.2 .",
    "guidance": "General Guidance\nAuthority and Responsibility\nFor the purposes of this section authority is defined as the delegated power or right to command or direct, to\nmake specific decisions, to grant permission and/or provide approval, or to control or modify a process.\nFor the purposes of this section responsibility is defined as an obligation to perform an assigned function,\nduty, task or action. An assignment of responsibility typically also requires the delegation of an appropriate\nlevel of authority.\nOperational Control\nOperational control is defined as the exercise of authority to initiate, continue, divert or terminate a flight in the\ninterest of the safety and security of the aircraft and its occupants. An operator may delegate the authority for\noperational control of a specific flight to qualified individuals, but typically retains overall authority to operate\nand control the entire operation. An operator may also assign the responsibility to carry out specific\noperational control functions, duties, or tasks related to the conduct of each flight to identifiable, qualified and\nknowledgeable individual(s), but would remain responsible (and accountable) for the conduct of the entire\noperation.\nAny individuals delegated the authority to make specific decisions regarding operational control would also\nbe responsible (and accountable) for those decisions. Additionally, individuals assigned the responsibility to\ncarry out specific operational control functions, duties, or tasks related to the conduct of each flight are also\nresponsible (and accountable) for the proper execution of those functions, duties, or tasks. In all cases, the\nauthority and responsibility attributes of operational control personnel are clearly defined and documented by\nthe operator and communicated throughout the organization.\nIt is important to note that when an operator assigns the responsibility for functions, duties or tasks related to\nthe initiation, continuation, diversion and termination of a flight to employees or external service providers,\nsuch operator retains full responsibility (and accountability) for the proper execution of those functions, duties\nor tasks by ensuring:\n The training and qualification of such personnel meets any regulatory and operator requirements;\n Personnel are performing their duties diligently;\n The provisions of the Operations Manual are being complied with;\n An effective means of oversight is maintained to monitor the actions of such personnel for the\npurposes of ensuring operator guidance and policy, as well regulatory requirements, are complied\nwith.\nAuthority for the Operational Control of Each Flight\nIn order to practically exercise operational control of flight operations, an operator typically delegates the\nauthority for the initiation, continuation, diversion or termination of each flight to qualified individuals. Such\ndelegation occurs in conjunction with an operator's overall system of operational control as follows:\n Shared systems, wherein operational control authority is shared between the pilot-in-command (PIC)\nanda flight operations officer/flight dispatcher (FOO) ordesignated member of management, such\nas the Director of Flight Operations (or other designated post holder); \nFor example: The FOO (or designated member of management, as applicable) has the authority to\ndivert, delay or terminate a flight if in the judgment of the FOO, a designated member of management\nor the PIC, the flight cannot operate or continue to operate safely as planned or released.\n Non-shared systems, wherein operational control authority is delegated only to the PIC.\nFor example: Only the PIC has the authority to terminate, delay, or divert a flight if in the judgment of\nthe PIC the flight cannot operate or continue to operate safely as planned.\nResponsibility for Operational Control of Each Flight\nWhile an operator retains full responsibility (and accountability) for the entire operation, the responsibility for\nthe practical operational control of each flight is typically assigned to qualified individuals. As with the\ndelegation of authority, the assignment of responsibility related to the operational control of each flight occurs\nin conjunction with a system of operational control as follows:\n Shared systems, wherein operational control responsibility for each flight is shared between the PIC\nand an FOO, or between the PIC and a designated member of management such as the Director of\nFlight Operations (or other designated post holder). In either shared system, the PIC, FOO or\ndesignated member of management, as applicable, may be assisted by other qualified personnel\nassigned the individual responsibility (by the operator) to carry out specific operational control\nfunctions, duties or tasks. Such personnel, however, typically do not share operational control\nresponsibility with the PIC, FOO or designated member of management, as applicable.\nFor example: The FOO (or designated member of management) and the PIC are jointly responsible\n(and accountable) for the functions, duties or tasks associated with the operational control of a flight,\nsuch as pre-flight planning, load planning, weight and balance, delay, dispatch release, diversion,\ntermination, etc. In such systems, the FOO (or designated member of management) may carry out\nsuch responsibilities unassisted or be assisted by qualified personnel assigned the individual\nresponsibility (by the operator) to carry out specific operational control functions, duties or tasks.\n Non-shared systems, wherein the PIC is solely responsible for all duties, functions, or tasks\nregarding operational control of each flight, and may carry out such responsibilities unassisted or be\nassisted by qualified personnel assigned the individual responsibility (by the operator) to carry out\nspecific operational control functions, duties or tasks.\nFor example: The PIC is solely responsible (and accountable) for the duties, functions, duties or\ntasks associated with the operational control of a flight, and the PIC either acts unassisted or is\nassisted by qualified personnel in carrying out functions, duties or tasks such as preflight planning,\nload planning, weight and balance, delay, dispatch release, diversion, termination, etc.\nResponsibility for Individual Operational Control Functions, Duties, or Tasks\nIt is important to note that, except for purely non-shared (PIC-only) systems, and as illustrated by the\nexamples in the previous paragraph, the assignment of responsibilities related to the operational control of\neach flight can be further subdivided among a number of qualified and specialized personnel. In such cases,\nthe responsibility for individual or specific operational control functions, duties or tasks is typically assigned to\nFOA personnel who support, brief and/or assist the PIC, FOO personnel and/or designated member(s) of\nmanagement, as applicable, in the safe conduct of each flight. Examples of such qualified personnel include\nWeather Analysts, Navigation Analysts/Flight Planning Specialists, Load Agents/Planners, Operations\nCoordinators/Planners/Controllers, Maintenance controllers and Air Traffic Specialists.\nNote: Some operators might choose to assign the responsibility for specialized operational control functions,\nsuch as those described in the example, to fully qualified FOO personnel. In such cases, an FOO, although\nqualified in all competencies of operational control, would be functionally acting as an FOA. Therefore, for the\npurpose of an audit, FOO personnel acting in this limited capacity are assessed as FOA personnel.\nNote: Load Agents/Planners/Controllers who perform load control functions within the scope of ground\nhandling operations may not be considered FOAs if trained and qualified in accordance with ISM Section 6\n(GRH), Subsection 2.1 , Training Program.\nAdministrative Support Personnel\nFOA personnel are not to be confused with administrative personnel that lack any operational control\nauthority, have very limited operational control responsibilities, and who simply provide, collect or assemble\noperational documents or data on behalf of the PIC, the FOO, designated member of management or the\noperator. \nAdministrative personnel may be present in any system of operational control, are excluded from the initial\nand continuing qualification provisions of this section and may be qualified as competent through on-the-job\ntraining (OJT), meeting criteria as specified in a job description, or through the mandatory use of written\ninstruments such as task cards, guidelines, or checklists.\nAdditional Note\nFor the purposes of this section, continuing qualification includes recurrent or refresher training as well as any\ntraining necessary to meet recency-of-experience requirements.\nDefinitions, Abbreviations, Acronyms\nDefinitions of technical terms used in this ISM Section 3 , as well as the meaning of abbreviations and\nacronyms, are found in the IATA Reference Manual for Audit Programs (IRM).\n1 Management and Control\n1.1 Management System Overview",
