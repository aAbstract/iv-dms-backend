The task listing covers the full range of conditions and contingencies - internal to the aircraft, external to the aircraft, normal, abnormal, and emergency - to which the pilot could be exposed within the Operator's sphere of operations.\nProficiency objectives are then extracted from the task and subtask analysis, respectively, for each duty position, and include identification of applicable performance, standards, and conditions. The documentation of proficiency objectives also identifies the references used, respectively, in defining performance, standards, and conditions for each.\nAn operator may elect to categorize certain proficiency objectives as currency items. Currency items refer to flight activities on which proficiency is maintained by virtue of frequent exercise during routine operations. Such items do not need to be addressed for training or proficiency evaluation purposes in periodic training sessions. However, verification is required that proficiency on such items is being maintained. Such verification might be obtained during line checks.\nAn operator could also elect to categorize proficiency objectives, including currency items, as critical or non-critical, based on operational significance and the consequences of error. This categorization is employed to determine the time interval within which training and evaluation on such items must occur for continuing qualification curricula. Critical proficiency objectives are trained and evaluated during an evaluation period the initial duration of which cannot exceed thirteen months. Each such evaluation period includes at least one training session. Non-critical terminal proficiency objectives may be distributed over a continuing qualification cycle the initial duration of which cannot exceed twenty-six months.\n- (ii)First Look Evaluations Performance on selected proficiency items will be evaluated prior to each formal training session and prior to any pre-briefing or practice. Such pre-evaluation data is used to determine the extent to which safety-critical skills might have decayed since previous training and/or checking, and provides a baseline for assessing degree of improvement attributable to subsequent training.\nConsistently poor pre-evaluation results occurring within the pilot group might indicate that curriculum modifications, including potentially the frequency and content of training, are warranted.\n- (iii)Continuing Qualification Cycles and Evaluation Periods After initial qualification, which incorporates training and evaluation on all proficiency objectives,\nfollow-on training will occur within a scheduling interval called a continuing qualification cycle. This is the time period during which all proficiency objectives are trained, validated, or evaluated for all crewmembers. The initial approval for a continuing qualification cycle is no more than 26 months in duration, divided into two 13-month evaluation periods. All critical proficiency objectives are accomplished during each evaluation period, and all currency proficiency objectives are accomplished during each continuing qualification cycle.\nThe initial duration of a continuing qualification cycle is 26 months, but it may be subsequently and incrementally extended by the Authority to a maximum of 39 months, contingent upon the results of performance proficiency data from each such cycle.\n- (iv)Training Sessions Each evaluation period shall include a minimum of one training session but may include more.\nInitially, training sessions cannot be more than 13 months apart.",
