Since these innovations may require some deviations from traditional regulations, the approved qualification standards may replace the applicable portions of the existing regulations and/or training guidance. These deviations or variances will be documented in the approved AQP documentation.\nAdditionally, an approved AQP Entry Level Analysis may be documented to achieve the most effective use of training resources. An Entry Level Analysis may also be used to identify where training is not needed or to justify alternative curriculum tracks or modules targeted at expected differences in entry background.\nIn an AQP, criticality and currency determination guides how and when training objectives are trained,\nvalidated or evaluated. A task factor analysis will be documented within the approved training qualification standards.\nThe specifications in this table apply to an AQP as specified in CAB 2.1.1B , and are in addition to those delineated in Table 5.2:\n- (i) Proficiency Objectives The Operator shall conduct a job task analysis beginning with the development of a comprehensive task listing for each duty position. The task listing covers the full range of conditions and contingencies - internal to the aircraft, external to the aircraft, normal, abnormal, and emergency -\nto which the cabin crew could be exposed within the Operator's sphere of operations. Proficiency objectives are then extracted from the task and subtask analysis, respectively, for each duty position, and include identification of applicable performance, standards, and conditions. The documentation of proficiency objectives also identifies the references used, respectively, in defining performance, standards, and conditions for each.\nAn operator may elect to categorize certain proficiency objectives as currency items. Currency items refer to activities on which proficiency is maintained by virtue of frequent exercise during routine operations. Such items do not need to be addressed for training or proficiency evaluation purposes in periodic training sessions. However, verification is required that proficiency on such items is being maintained. Such verification might be obtained during line checks.\nAn operator could also elect to categorize proficiency objectives, including currency items, as critical or non-critical, based on operational significance and the consequences of error. This categorization is employed to determine the time interval within which training and evaluation on such items must occur for continuing qualification curricula. Critical proficiency objectives are trained and evaluated during an evaluation period the initial duration of which cannot exceed thirteen months. Each such evaluation period includes at least one training session. Non-critical terminal proficiency objectives may be distributed over a continuing qualification cycle the initial duration of which cannot exceed twenty-six months.\n- (ii) Continuing Qualification Cycles and Evaluation Periods After initial qualification, which incorporates training and evaluation on all proficiency objectives,\nfollow-on training will occur within a scheduling interval called a continuing qualification cycle. This is the time period during which all terminal and supporting proficiency objectives are trained,\nvalidated, or evaluated. The initial approval for a continuing qualification cycle is no more than 26 months in duration, divided into two 13-month evaluation periods. All critical proficiency objectives are accomplished during each evaluation period, and all currency proficiency objectives are accomplished during each continuing qualification cycle.\nThe initial duration of a continuing qualification cycle is 26 months, which may be subsequently and incrementally extended by the Authority to a maximum of 39 months, contingent upon the results of performance proficiency data from each such cycle.\n- (iii) Training Sessions Each evaluation period must include a minimum of one training session but may include more.\nInitially, training sessions cannot be more than 13 months apart.",
