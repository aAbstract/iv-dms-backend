If this situation\nexists, the operator must be in conformity with the ISARPs contained in Section 6 , Ground Handling\nOperations (GRH), that are applicable to the ground handling functions performed by maintenance\noperations personnel.\nWhere an operator outsources the performance of aircraft engineering and maintenance operational\nfunctions to external organizations, the operator retains overall responsibility for ensuring aircraft\nairworthiness, and must demonstrate processes for monitoring the applicable external organization(s) in\naccordance with MNT 1.11.7 .",
    "guidance": "General Guidance\nDefinitions of technical terms used in this ISM Section 4 , as well as the meaning of abbreviations and\nacronyms, are found in the IATA Reference Manual for Audit Programs (IRM).\nMany provisions in this section contain the phrase  organization that performs maintenance (or performs\nmaintenance functions) for the Operator.  This phrase is inclusive and refers to any organizations that might\nperform maintenance on the operator s aircraft, either an external maintenance organization or the operator s\nown maintenance organization.\nThe term  maintenance  as used in above-referenced phrase means restoring or maintaining an aircraft,\naircraft engine or aircraft component to or in an airworthy and serviceable condition through the performance\nof functions such as repair, modification, overhaul, inspection, replacement, defect rectification and/or\ndetermination of condition.\nIf a standard or recommended practice requires an operator to ensure that certain provisions (specifically in\nMNT subsection 4) are satisfied by an organization that performs maintenance or maintenance operational\nfunctions for the operator under a maintenance agreement, then the operator monitors such maintenance\norganization to ensure specifications in the relevant ISARPs are being fulfilled.\nIf the organization that has a maintenance agreement with the operator subcontracts certain maintenance\nfunctions to other maintenance organizations (as agreed between parties), then the operator s monitoring of\nthe contracted maintenance organization would also ensure such organization is performing oversight of all\nrelevant subcontractors. For example, when an operator contracts with an airframe maintenance provider to\nconduct base maintenance and such maintenance provider then subcontracts certain maintenance activities\nor functions to one or more of its subcontractors, the operator s monitoring would also ensure the contracted\nairframe maintenance provider is providing proper oversight of the relevant subcontractors.\n1 Management and Control\n1.1 Management System Overview",
