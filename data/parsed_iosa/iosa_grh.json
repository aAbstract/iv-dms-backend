COMAT is non-revenue cargo.\nFor the purpose of addressing cargo in this section, mail is considered to be an item of cargo. Therefore,\nany reference to cargo also includes mail.\nWhere an operator outsources the performance of ground handling operational functions to external\nservice providers, the operator retains overall responsibility for ensuring the management of safety in the\nconduct of such operations and must demonstrate processes for monitoring applicable external service\nproviders in accordance with GRH 1.10.2 .",
    "guidance": "General Guidance\nDefinitions of technical terms used in this ISM Section 6 , as well as the meaning of abbreviations and\nacronyms, are found in the IATA Reference Manual for Audit Programs (IRM).\nProcesses and procedures for use in ground handling operations are defined in the IATA Ground Operations\nManual (IGOM), the IATA Airport Handling Manual (AHM), the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) and in\nother relevant IATA publications.\nDue to revision cycle differences, the IATA documents cited above are typically revised at various times\nduring the effective period of an ISM edition. Accordingly, when an IATA document is revised, it could render\nan existing reference to specific information in an IATA document to be in error. In such case, the revised\nIATA document would have to be searched to find the specific information referenced.\n1 Management and Control\n1.1 Management System Overview",
